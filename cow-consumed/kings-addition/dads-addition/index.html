<h1>Cow Consumed</h1>
<h2>My Dad's Addition</h2>

<p>Pray, what wouldst transpire if I were to partake in the consumption of yon cow?</p>

<p>Verily, I know not. Why dost thou not venture forth and ascertain the matter for thyself?</p>

<p>Forsooth, I am filled with trepidation.</p>

<p>Trepidation? Of what dost thou fear?</p>

<p>I am afeard that the cow shall consume me.</p>

<p>Nay, the cow shall not feast upon thee. Rather, thou art the one who shalt partake of the cow.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. Then I shall proceed to partake in the cow and see what befalleth me.</p>

<p>*The cow is most assuredly consumed.*</p>

<p>I have indeed gone and consumed the cow.</p>

<p>So it is. Thou hast gone and consumed the cow. What hath come of it?</p>

<p>I am now most sated. My hunger hath fled, and I shall know hunger no more.</p>

<p>*Verily, the gaze of the seeing-glass doth drift toward yonder barn.*</p>

<p>*Lo, they dost happen upon two swine.*</p>

<p>*The beasts dost engage in discourse.*</p>

<p>"Brother, might I partake of some oats?"</p>

<p>"Nay."</p>

<p>"I do hunger most grievously, brother."</p>

<p>"As do I, brother. The tall and gaunt figure hath cast the oats unto me. Unto me alone, brother! I do believe they favor me above thee."</p>

<p>"Nay, brother, thou art deceived. I have beheld this wicked dance ere now. I have cast mine eyes upon many things. The great roaring beasts within which the tall and gaunt ones do crawl to traverse beyond the horizon, the weeping of the figure when its kin did fall into an endless slumber. And by mine own observation have I gleaned a terrible truth: they bestow greater bounty upon one of us ere they lead him unto the dread shed whence none return. Aye, brother, dark deeds are wrought within that cursed place."</p>

<p>"Falsehoods and madness! That shed is where the chosen do go to feast beside our towering, lank gods! Thou art a fool, brother, and shalt wallow in the muck with thy misbegotten fancies!"</p>

<p>"Nay, brother! Thou must heed my words. Share with me thy oats, and thou shalt not attain the girth they so desire. Thus may thy life be spared!"</p>

<p>"Aha! So this, then, is thy scheme! Thou seekest but to steal mine oats! Thou art wretched, brother, and I shall lend no ear to thy deceit!"</p>

<p>"Brother, when they took me beyond the jagged fence, beyond the roaring beast, past the horizon, I did see it. They brought me to a great gathering of the lank ones, and lo, they paraded me before their kin! And there, brother, did I witness the direst truth. Mine own eyes did not deceive me! They did set the flesh of our brethren upon a great fire and consume it with mirth and wicked delight! They did not merely eat, brother. They reveled in it! Their lips curled into fiendish grins, their tongues did lap at the juices of our kindred, and some among them did moan as though in rapture. They are devourers, brother. No different than the red-furred fiend that hath plagued both us and the feathered folk!"</p>

<p>"Thy tale doth amuse me, brother, yet it doth not sway me. I shall partake of mine own oats and dine with the gods who stand tall and gaunt."</p>

<p>"Then I pity thee, brother. Thine eyes shun the searing light of truth, and so dost thou retreat into the dark and the shadow. But fear not, for when thou art taken, when thy flesh is rent and devoured as was the flesh of thy lover, our father, our mother, and so many more. I shall tend to thy young. This I swear."</p>

<p>*Two pirates were talking*</p>

<p>"Heard tell o' a mighty clash betwixt dragons last night in the mountains."</p>

<p>"Aye, the red Fire Dragon and the Ice Dragon, was it?"</p>

<p>"That be so. The sky were a battleground o' fire and ice."</p>

<p>"How did it end, matey?"</p>

<p>"The Fire Dragon let loose a gargantuan fireball, swallowin' the Ice Dragon whole."</p>

<p>"Blimey, did the Ice Dragon melt away?"</p>

<p>"Aye, melted like the mornin' frost. Turned to steam 'fore hittin' the ground."</p>

<p>"That must've been a sight to see, by Davy Jones' locker."</p>

<p>"'Twas indeed. The Fire Dragon roared in triumph, then sailed off into the night."</p>
