<h1>Cow Consumed</h1>
<h2>Original</h2>

<p>Pray, what wouldst transpire if I were to partake in the consumption of yon cow?</p>

<p>Verily, I know not. Why dost thou not venture forth and ascertain the matter for thyself?</p>

<p>Forsooth, I am filled with trepidation.</p>

<p>Trepidation? Of what dost thou fear?</p>

<p>I am afeard that the cow shall consume me.</p>

<p>Nay, the cow shall not feast upon thee. Rather, thou art the one who shalt partake of the cow.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. Then I shall proceed to partake in the cow and see what befalleth me.</p>

<p>*The cow is most assuredly consumed.*</p>

<p>I have indeed gone and consumed the cow.</p>

<p>So it is. Thou hast gone and consumed the cow. What hath come of it?</p>

<p>I am now most sated. My hunger hath fled, and I shall know hunger no more.</p>
