        <h1>About ARGHosting</h1>
        <p>ARGHosting was originally going to be a server hosting website primarily for Minecraft. But, I decided I didn't want to do that and that I wanted to just put random stuff on here.</p>
        <p>However, there are also some slightly more serious stuff like the official store (WIP) and the other store thingy called "Pocket Pictures" (also WIP)</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, you can contact me below:</p>
